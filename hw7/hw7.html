    <h1>State Distribution of US Public School Teachers (2012)</h1>
    <h3>This map depicts the 2012 distribution of US public school (PS) teachers per state. Some states spend more on their public schools than others, and I wondered if this would be reflected in the number of teachers in each state. I normalized this data by dividing the number of PS teachers per state by the total number of PS teachers in the US. Clearly, states with larger populations have a larger percentage of teachers, but there seem to be some discrepancies among mid-sized states. The most recent data I could find was from 2012, but I think it would be interesting to compare this to post-COVID teacher numbers. White states on the map have no data.</h3>
