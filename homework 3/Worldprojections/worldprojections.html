    <h2 style="color:rgba(13, 107, 145, 0.527)">This is how I did it in QGIS:</h2>
    <p>I used a shapefile from naturalearth and the Tissot's Indicatrix plugin to create each of these projections. I set each map to a different projection and used the Indicatrix to model distortions caused by each projection.</p>
    
    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">WGS84 Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Mercator projection is a classic! This is the one I am most familiar with. The Mercator projection conserves area, which is why the shape of regions near the poles is distorted.</h3>

    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff projection creates distortions in shape and area. This projection is best for small-scale mapping.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">WGS84 Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo-Mercator projection creates a much longer map than other projections (some of it is cut off in the image). Land shape is conserved, but area becomes distorted closer to the poles. </h3>

    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">Winkel 1 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Winkel I projection has bulges at the edges, making the spaces between the furthest east and west latitudes wider. Area is distorted and is largest at the poles. </h3>

    </a>
    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">Sphere/Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>As the name suggests, the Equal Area projection conserves area. This causes distortion in the shape of polar regions, making them quite flat. This is not an ideal projection for mapping polar regions.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>The conic projection conserves distance, but creates distortions in area and shape. The points closest to the center of the circle (point of the cone) are the least distorted. This is not my favorite projection.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54027.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54027.png" alt="Conic" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">Equidistant Azimuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>The azimuthal projection is similar to the conic projection. It also conserves distance, distorting areas close to the South Pole. I like that the azimuthal projeciton makes a complete circle, as opposed to the conic projection which has a gap.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/102016.png">
    <img src=".//maps/102016.png" alt="Azimuthal" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">World Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>At first glance, the World Robinson projection looks very similar to the World Mercator. It conserves shape well, but does have some bulging on the sides. This projection conserves area well, as seen by the difference in size of Greenland and Africa.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54030.png">

    </a>
    <h2 style ="color:rgb(109, 52, 202)">World Cassini Projection</h2>
    <h3>I chose to include this projection because it looks wacky! It looks like an orange that has been peeled like a banana (from the top down). This projection does not conserve area, shape, or distance, so it doesn't seem very useful. I do like how easy it is to understand the geometry of this projection.</h3>
